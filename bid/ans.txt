Describe your approach to testing and improving QA-------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Honestly, I haven't written tests in the past as the clients I worked with didn't want testing implementation. However, I do these things to make sure the code is clean and readable: descriptive names, single-purpose functions, descriptive messages during git commits, empty lines to improve readability, clean files & directory architecture.

I have worked on tests in my previous projects as well.

Writing automated tests so that the manual work can be reduced and testing will get faster





Please list any certifications related to this project-------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have certifications in these Udemy courses:
1: JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2022 (Beginner + Advanced) by Maximilian Schwarzmüller
2: React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) by Maximilian Schwarzmüller

I think my upwork profile can define it better than certifications?

This is the recent project I worked on - It uses some of the technologies listed in your tech stack e.g. NextJS, TypeScript & GraphQL. This is actually a multi-sided marketplace to connect language learners and trainers and I felt pretty comfortable working with this codebase. I worked on its both parts i.e. frontend & backend.

Its been almost 5/6 years working with the tech stack required for the job, but i have intermediate expeience on prisma but thats just because i had not got much time to look into that.
I have helped many startups and individuals to get the project deployed, the longest project i worked for is breakernation.com which is music platform with web/mobile app
