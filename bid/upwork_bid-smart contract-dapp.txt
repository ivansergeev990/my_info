Hello, I am really interested in this job. I have worked as a lead developer in several blockchain teams and built a lot of dApps so far.
You can check some of them here.

Let's have an interview to discuss further details.

###############################################################

Hi,
I have read your project description carefully. I think I still need more details. I have a Ph.D. degree in Software Engineering, and I have done commercial and free open-source projects in the blockchain ecosystem and its security audits, but just recently, I have signed in to Upwork.

I should state that I have in-depth experience in blockchain programming as well, particularly with Solidity for the smart contract ecosystem. I am also fully aware of blockchain-associated concepts, such as the pros and cons of various blockchain architectures, designing ERC20/721/1155 tokens, Binance Smart Chain, trusted execution environment (TEE), the MEV inspection, and performing security audit and exploitation of various blockchain codes.


I often use the Openzeppelin library in terms of smart contract tokens, which results in more secure tokens.
Moreover, I have been working as a full-stack web developer for several companies such as Berlin Digital Career Institute for few years. I have developed many commercial web applications via React and Node.js for different individuals startups. Thus, I can contribute to your project in both programmings.

In terms of smart contract programming, I have created some blockchain projects based on Solidity and even Rust (you can find the details on my CV, website, and GitHub profile) using full-stack technologies and protocols as follows:
Solidity
Rust
JavaScript
React
Truffle
Openzeppelin
Ganache
Ethers.JS
Brownie

Apart from designing a high-quality blockchain program (token, coin, Dapp, Defi. etc.), safety and security would be the next critical point in my designs. Because smart contracts (blockchain apps generally) are immutable, that means developers CANNOT fix any bugs/vulnerabilities after releasing the smart contract on a target blockchain.

Accordingly, introducing a reliable and successful smart contract project requires sufficient programming knowledge and extensive knowledge and experience of security audit/fuzzing and understanding various security threats in this emerging ecosystem. In this regard, I always perform the following security vulnerabilities testing during my blockchain developments:

Integer Overflow and Underflow
Reentrancy
Timestamp Dependence
DoS with (Unexpected) revert
Block Gas Limit Bug
Sandwich Attack
Front-running

you can also check my security service startup at the following link:
https://securecontract.io

Furthermore, I always leverage the CI/CD tools to enhance my projects' quality.
Thus, in addition to conventional CI/CD tools (e.g., GitLab and Jenkins), I use Ganache and Docker (https://hub.docker.com/r/trufflesuite/ganache-cli/) for running tests on my smart contracts.


In terms of code documentation, smart contract documentation is a critical part of a blockchain development lifecycle. It must be carried out
in order to create a full-fledged and highly reputable piece of code. Note that in the absence of proper code documentation,
if you hire a new developer who joins your team in the future, she won't be able to peak into the system and understand how it works efficiently.
For my smart-contract projects, I often use solidity-docgen, which introduces one of the best forms for smart contract documentation, i.e., the Ethereum Natural Language Specification Format (NatSpec).

Hi,

I have 4 years of experience and excellent skills in developing smart contracts(ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, ...) using solidity.
So I am professional in solidity, web3.js, Opensea, IPFS, metamask, and so on.

Especially, I have developed 5+ projects to develop ERC20 token projects with complicated custom tokenomic and logic such as
1. Several tax percents
2. Reflect reward to holders in token or cruptocurrency(ETHER, BNB)
3. Buy or sell lock or cooldown.
4. Lock wallets

I am ready to discuss the details and very confident to complete this project successfully.
I am looking forward to working with you.
