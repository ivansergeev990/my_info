Hello, I have a lot of experience developing web applications using ReactJS. 
If you hire me, I will deliver a high quality web application for you.
Thank you for your time and I look forward to working with you.

Hi 
I have been working as a Front End Web Developer for the past five years, and have gained extensive experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, ES6/7, TypeScript, React, Next, and Vue. I have also worked with other programming languages such as Node, PHP and Python. My experience includes developing websites for businesses, ecommerce and personal projects.

My greatest strength is my ability to work independently. I am able to take on projects from start to finish without needing constant supervision or guidance. I am also very comfortable working with clients to understand their needs and requirements before starting any project. This allows me to develop websites that are not only functional but also meet the client’s needs and expectations.

I would like to thank you for your time and consideration of my bid. I look forward to chatting from you soon.
