Hi, I can help you with NFT, Blockchain projects.
My core experience ranges from both front-end blockchain applications to back-end architecture design and implementation, smart contract development, and development of dApps for Fintech and other industries that need the push of decentralization, tokenization, and smart contracts.
I have been working on various NFT marketplace development from scratch, such as NFT minting, NFT swap, NFT with art, NFT integration with OpenSea, and Open Sea clone for the NFT marketplace, Metaplex/Candy Machine NFT project, Solana Based NFT Marketplace.
Most recently, I have created a NFT(Non-fungible token) Project similar to yours.
It was a minting website on ethereum, which collection would be traded on OpenSea, minting on the website avoiding gas wars on the day of minting so that users wanted to create a whitelist of interested buyers and those on the white list would have a certain period to mint their NFT.
Here is my recent work, which you can check:
https://www.robotos.art (ethereum)(frontend:react, smart contract: solidity)
https://badbunniesnft.com/ (solana)(frontend:next, smart contract: rust)
https://wildapegang.com/(ethereum)(frontend:react, smart contract: solidity)
https://highrollersnft.com (solana: 3D)(frontend:next, smart contract: rust)

I can show you a proof of my recent work.
