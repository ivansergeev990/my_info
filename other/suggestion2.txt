So this is a partnership based business and you will get income every month. 
I was a top rated developer on upwork but my brother is using my account now.  
He is student so he can not create his own account. 
I usually earned my main income from there.  
so if you can help me to work there again. 
I will make you get income every month. 

$200 everymonth or 15% income if i earn more than 1.5k

You need to do
- create a dev account on upwork
- verify it on upwork
- give me access to the account
- send payment(my share) to me

I will handle all other things
- do bids
- win jobs
- finish them successfully
And get paid

But please remember you don't create a dev account by yourself on your end because once it's created, it's very risky and difficult to change it.
Please let me know if you interest
