4. Setting milestones

   How about setting milestones on this project?
   I prefer to go with an upfront milestone.

   It would be good if you proceed payment with Payoneer since it is no fee.
   This is a business paypal that I use with a Chinese colleague.

   Is it possible for us to go with Paypal?
   I will send you an invoice every week.
